I'm Zac, a fourth-year graduate student (and now PhD candidate) at the California Institute of Technology studying planetary science. Iâ€™m currently working on a project studying visible/infrared aurora on Jupiter's Galilean satellites Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. I used to work at the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, where I was a part of the MAVEN/IUVS science team studying Martian atmospheric ultraviolet airglow phenomena like nitric oxide nightglow and aurora.
