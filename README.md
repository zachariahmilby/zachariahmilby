I'm Zac, a first-year graduate student at the California Institute of Technology studying planetary science. Iâ€™m currently working on a project studying visible/infrared oxygen aurora on Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede. I used to work at the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, where I was a part of the MAVEN/IUVS science team studying Martian atmospheric airglow phenomena like nitric oxide nightglow and aurora.
