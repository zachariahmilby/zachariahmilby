I'm Zac, a first year graduate student at the California Institute of Technology studying planetary science. Iâ€™m currently working on a project studying visible/infrared oxygen aurora on Jupiter's icy Galilean satellites Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. I'm also working on a planet formation theory project deriving pebble-accretion cross sections for non-circular orbits. I used to work at the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, where I was a part of the MAVEN/IUVS science team studying Martian atmospheric ultraviolet airglow phenomena like nitric oxide nightglow and aurora.
